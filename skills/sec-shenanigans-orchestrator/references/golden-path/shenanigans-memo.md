## Executive Summary

Risk level: Moderate-High. Three signals point to revenue-quality and cash-conversion stress.

## Risk Register Summary

- RK-001 (EM1, high): policy change plus AR behavior suggests pull-forward risk.
- RK-002 (EM5, medium): declining allowance coverage may defer future expense recognition.
- RK-003 (CF3, medium): CFO weakened materially despite higher net income.

## Evidence Highlights

- EV-001: channel recognition policy shifted to sell-in.
- EV-002: AR growth outpaced revenue and allowance coverage fell.
- EV-003: CFO dropped while net income increased.

## Ratio Diagnostics Summary

- DSO rose from 68 to 82 days.
- CFO/NI dropped from 1.74 to 0.58.

## Confidence and Uncertainty

Confidence is medium overall; strongest support is EM1. Uncertainty remains on customer mix and disclosed one-time collection delays.

## Diligence Priorities

1. Request sell-in/sell-through channel inventory reconciliation.
2. Request allowance rollforward and write-off aging details.
3. Request quarter-end billing and collection cut-off analysis.
