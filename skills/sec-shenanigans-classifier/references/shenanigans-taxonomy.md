# Shenanigans Taxonomy for SEC Analysis

This reference is based on the Summary List and supported by chapter themes in Financial Shenanigans (4th ed.).

## Earnings Manipulation (EM)

- `EM1` Recording revenue too soon
  - Cues: earlier recognition policy, shipment timing games, acceptance risk ignored, extended terms with rising receivables.
- `EM2` Recording bogus revenue
  - Cues: related-party sales lacking substance, round-trips/barter, non-revenue cash presented as revenue.
- `EM3` Boosting income using one-time or unsustainable activities
  - Cues: gains and reclassifications mixed into recurring performance, serial “special” benefits.
- `EM4` Shifting current expenses to later periods
  - Cues: unusual capitalization, longer useful lives, slow amortization, weak impairment discipline.
- `EM5` Employing other techniques to hide expenses or losses
  - Cues: under-accruals, aggressive assumptions, reserve releases supporting earnings.
- `EM6` Shifting current income to later periods
  - Cues: cookie-jar reserve builds and smoothing behavior.
- `EM7` Shifting future expenses to current period
  - Cues: oversized current write-offs/restructuring to create easier future comps.

## Cash Flow (CF)

- `CF1` Shifting financing cash inflows to Operating
  - Cues: borrowings or receivable monetization presented as CFFO-like strength.
- `CF2` Moving operating cash outflows to other sections
  - Cues: operating costs reclassified as investing/financing cash uses.
- `CF3` Boosting operating cash flow using unsustainable activities
  - Cues: temporary working-capital maneuvers, pulled-forward collections.

## Key Metrics (KM)

- `KM1` Showcasing misleading metrics that overstate performance
  - Cues: custom metrics without stable definition, selective exclusions, pro forma emphasis over GAAP.
- `KM2` Distorting Balance Sheet metrics to avoid showing deterioration
  - Cues: manipulated reserve/allowance/quality indicators hiding stress.

## Acquisition Accounting (AA)

- `AA1` Artificially boosting revenue and earnings
  - Cues: post-deal policy changes that accelerate revenue or suppress expense.
- `AA2` Inflating reported cash flow
  - Cues: deal-structure or classification effects creating misleading operating cash optics.
- `AA3` Manipulating key metrics
  - Cues: acquisition-adjusted KPIs that mask organic weakness or integration costs.

## SEC-Focused Distinction Rules

- Prefer `AA*` when deal timing is central to the signal.
- Prefer `KM*` when the core issue is metric design/definition rather than GAAP line items.
- Pair `EM4` with `CF2` when capitalization both lifts earnings and shifts cash presentation.
