# SEC Shenanigans Memo Writer

Write decision-ready memos that separate evidence, interpretation, and uncertainty.

## Workflow

1. Start from evidence table, classification register, and metric checks.
1. Rank risks by potential decision impact.
1. Write concise claims with explicit supporting evidence ids.
1. Include counterarguments and what would invalidate each claim.
1. End with targeted diligence questions and monitor list.

## Memo Structure

1. Executive risk summary (3-7 bullets)
1. Top Shenanigans hypotheses by category
1. Evidence highlights with filing anchors
1. Quantitative diagnostics that support or weaken each hypothesis
1. Confidence and uncertainty register
1. Next-step diligence requests

## Writing Rules

- Use neutral forensic tone.
- Avoid legal conclusions; present analytical hypotheses.
- Quote short filing language only when wording is pivotal.
- Clearly mark missing data and unresolved contradictions.
- Provide a watchlist even when no high-confidence findings exist.
