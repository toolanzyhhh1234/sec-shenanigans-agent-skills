# SEC Filing Hotspots

Use these anchors while extracting evidence.

## 10-K / 10-Q

- MD&A: results drivers, unusual quarter-end activity, liquidity narratives
- Notes: revenue recognition, receivables, reserves, impairment, debt covenants
- Cash Flow statement and footnotes: reclassifications, factoring, supplier finance
- Non-GAAP section and earnings release exhibits: metric definitions and exclusions
- Business combinations: purchase accounting, synergies, pro forma adjustments

## 8-K

- Earnings release exhibits for new KPIs and adjusted metrics
- Audit committee or investigation disclosures
- Acquisition close announcements and updated transaction terms

## Red-Flag Disclosure Patterns

- Definition changes not reconciled across periods
- Large favorable one-time items near quarter-end
- Reserve reductions during weakening business conditions
- Sudden working-capital improvements not matched by fundamentals
- Repeated “non-recurring” adjustments that recur
