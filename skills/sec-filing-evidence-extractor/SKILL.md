# SEC Filing Evidence Extractor

Extract section-anchored facts before interpretation.

## Workflow

1. Identify filing set and periods.
1. Prefer latest annual plus at least 8 quarters.
1. Extract evidence rows with exact filing anchors and numbers.
1. Validate schema against bundle contract.
1. Write artifact `evidence-table.md`.

## Required Output Artifact

Write `evidence-table.md` with required columns defined in `../sec-shenanigans-orchestrator/references/bundle-contract.md`.

## Quality Rules

- Keep one factual disclosure per row.
- Separate extraction confidence from manipulation confidence.
- Preserve sign and units in `numbers`.
- Mark ambiguous extraction with `confidence=low`.

## Pre-Stage Input Helper

If raw statement tables are missing, orchestrator may run:

```bash
python skills/sec-shenanigans-orchestrator/scripts/fetch_financial_sheets.py <TICKER>
```

Use generated markdown only as a data helper; keep evidence anchored to SEC filing sections.

Use `references/sec-filing-hotspots.md` for section priorities.
